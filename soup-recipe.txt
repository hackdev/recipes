 Black bean soup

Ingredients:
 - 4 regular (15 OZ) cans of Goya black beans (or 2 large ones)
 - 4.5 cups of water
 - half of jalapeno pepper (optional)
 - one onion
 - two celery stems
 - carrot (that's optional)
 - olive oil
 - 2 tsp of cumin powder
 - garlic
 - salt
 - small lemon

Directions:
1. open 4 regular (15 OZ) cans of Goya black beans (or 2 large ones), drain the beans and put them in a pot.

2. Add 4.5 cups of water, bring to boil and cook on slow heat for 15-20 minutes. (don't taste-the plain beans taste real bad)

2a. If you like spicy version, cook half of jalapeno pepper in the pot with beans. It's going to be really spicy and real Mexican!

3. Meanwhile, cut one onion (yes, onion!) into small pieces, 2 celery stems and you may add a carrot (that's optional) also finely cut. Put it all into preheated olive oil on a frying pan. One special ingredient without which you cannot cook this soup - cumin seeds. They give the soup its special flavor. I prefer cumin powder. So, add 2 teaspoons of the powder into the vegetables while sauteing them. When you feel the vegetables are almost ready, add some garlic into the pan (very finely cut). It should be sauteed for 3-4 minutes.

4. When everything is sauteed, add it into the pot of beans.

5. Now put some salt (I never know how much exactly - I do everything to taste). And squeeze the whole small lemon into the soup. Let it boil on slow heat with everything now for 5 minutes and turn it off. You may add some more cumin powder into the soup directly before you turn the heat off. Soup is ready. It should be served with sour cream and bread crumbles. Some people put half of the beans from soup into the blender and then add them back. I don't do this. Also, I read that the original black ban soup should be cooked with smoked ribs and meat, but I prefer healthier version.


Hope you enjoy cooking it as much as eating it.
